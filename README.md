# Diabetes Prediction

A machine learning project for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on clinical features. This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline: from data loading and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction. The project aims to demonstrate the application of supervised learning techniques in health informatics for disease risk prediction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-hey-0/diabetes_prediction.git
   cd diabetes_prediction
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Common libraries used:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation
   - `numpy` for numerical computations
   - `scikit-learn` for modeling
   - `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for visualization
   - `joblib` for model serialization

---

## Usage

To run the full training and evaluation pipeline:

```bash
python main.py --train --evaluate
```

To predict diabetes for new patient data:

```bash
python main.py --predict --input data/new_patients.csv
```

Or use the Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for interactive exploration.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) or a similar clinical dataset with the following features:

- `Pregnancies`
- `Glucose`
- `BloodPressure`
- `SkinThickness`
- `Insulin`
- `BMI`
- `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
- `Age`
- `Outcome` (target variable: 1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic)

---

## Modeling Approach

- **Data preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
- **Feature engineering:** Optionally create new features or select relevant features.
- **Model selection:** Try multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** Use grid search or cross-validation to optimize models.
- **Model evaluation:** Assess performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions.
- **Precision & Recall:** For imbalanced classes.
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC:** Model's ability to distinguish between classes.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual assessment of predictions.

---

## Results

The best model achieved the following scores on the test set:

| Metric         | Score    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Accuracy       | 0.87     |
| Precision      | 0.82     |
| Recall         | 0.85     |
| F1-Score       | 0.83     |
| ROC-AUC        | 0.89     |

> *Note: These are example values. Actual results may vary based on data and model configuration.*
